Keeping the current situation in mind, I've been compelled to bid my appeal.
I've reached a financial impasse due to no source of income whatsoever. With the
current pandemic taking it's toll, not receiving any income has only added to my problems.
I'm a worker of kantipur management preference who hasn't received a single penny over the 
course of the pandemic. These past few months have been particularly hard with glooming problems
of both finace and health. Hence, I would like to appeal for some kind of financial aid in this 
pandemic. I would be highly obliged of any support received.
