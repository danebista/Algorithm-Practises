6 Maximum Number of Prizes Problem Introduction You are organizing a funny competition for children. 
As a prize fund you have n candies. 
You would like to use these candies for top k places in a competition with a natural restriction that a higher place gets a larger number of candies. 
To make as many children happy as possible, you are going to find the largest value of k for which it is possible.
Problem Description Task. The goal of this problem is to represent a given positive integer n as a sum of as many pairwise distinct positive integers as possible. 
That is, to find the maximum k such that n can be written as a1 + a2 +иии+ ak where a1,...,ak are positive integers and ai ?= aj for all 1 = i < j = k. 
Input Format. 
The input consists of a single integer n. 
Constraints. 1 = n = 109. 
Output Format. 
In the first line, output the maximum number k such that n can be represented as a sum of k pairwise distinct positive integers. 
In the second line, output k pairwise distinct positive integers that sum up to n 
(if there are many such representations, output any of them).
Sample 1. 
Input: 6 
Output: 3 1 2 3
Sample 2. 
Input: 8 
Output: 3 1 2 5
Sample 3. 
Input: 2 
Output: 1 2
