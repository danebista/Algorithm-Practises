Number of Inversions Problem Introduction 
An inversion of a sequence a0,a1,...,an-1 is a pair of indices 0 = i < j < n such that ai > aj. 
The number of inversions of a sequence in some sense measures how close the sequence is to being sorted. 
For example, a sorted (in non-descending order) sequence contains no inversions at all, while in a sequence sorted in descending order any two elements constitute an inversion (for a total of n(n-1)/2 inversions).

Problem Description Task. 
The goal in this problem is to count the number of inversions of a given sequence. 
Input Format. The first line contains an integer n, the next one contains a sequence of integers a0,a1,...,an-1. 
Constraints. 1 = n = 105, 1 = ai = 109 for all 0 = i < n. Output Format. Output the number of inversions in the sequence.
Sample 1. Input: 5 2 3 9 2 9 Output: 2 The two inversions here are (1,3) (a1 = 3 > 2 = a3) and (2,3) (a2 = 9 > 2 = a3).
What To Do This problem can be solved by modifying the merge sort algorithm. 
For this, we change both the Merge and MergeSort procedures as follows:
· Merge(B, C) returns the resulting sorted array and the number of pairs (b,c) such that b ? B, c ? C, and b > c; 
· MergeSort(A) returns a sorted array A and the number of inversions in A.
