3 Car Fueling Problem Introduction 
You are going to travel to another city that is located d miles away from your home city. 
Your car can travel at most m miles on a full tank and you start with a full tank. 
Along your way, there are gas stations at distances stop1,stop2,...,stopn from your home city. 
What is the minimum number of refills needed?
Problem Description Input Format. 
The first line contains an integer d. 
The second line contains an integer m. 
The third line specifies an integer n. 
Finally, the last line contains integers stop1,stop2,...,stopn. 
Output Format. Assuming that the distance between the cities is d miles, a car can travel at most m miles on a full tank,
and there are gas stations at distances stop1,stop2,...,stopn along the way, output the minimum number of refills needed. 
Assume that the car starts with a full tank. If it is not possible to reach the destination, output -1. 
Constraints. 1 = d = 105. 1 = m = 400. 1 = n = 300. 0 < stop1 < stop2 < иии < stopn < d. 
Sample 1. Input: 950 400 4 200 375 550 750 
Output: 2 The distance between the cities is 950, the car can travel at most 400 miles on a full tank. 
It suffices to make two refills: at points 375 and 750. 
This is the minimum number of refills as with a single refill one would only be able to travel at most 800 miles.
Sample 2. 
Input: 10 3 4 1 2 5 9 
Output: -1 
One cannot reach the gas station at point 9 as the previous gas station is too far away.
