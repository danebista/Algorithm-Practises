Problem Description Task. 
The goal in this code problem is to implement the binary search algorithm. 
Input Format. 
The first line of the input contains an integer n and a sequence a0 < a1 < ... < an-1 of n pairwise distinct positive integers in increasing order. 

The next line contains an integer k and k positive integers b0,b1,...,bk-1. 
Constraints. 1 = k = 105; 1 = n = 3·104; 1 = ai = 109 for all 0 = i < n; 1 = bj = 109 for all 0 = j < k; 
Output Format. For all i from 0 to k-1, output an index 0 = j = n-1 such that aj = bi or -1 if there is no such index.
Sample 1. 
Input: 5 1 5 8 12 13 5 8 1 23 1 11 
Output: 2 0 -1 0 -1 
In this sample, we are given an increasing sequence a0 = 1, a1 = 5, a2 = 8, a3 = 12, a4 = 13 of length five and five keys to search: 8,1,23,1,11. 
We see that a2 = 8 and a0 = 1, but the keys 23 and 11 do not appear in the sequence a. For this reason, we output a sequence 2,0,-1,0,-1.
