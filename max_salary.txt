Task. Compose the largest number out of a set of integers. Input Format. The first line of the input contains an integer n. 
The second line contains integers a1,a2,...,an. Constraints. 1 = n = 100; 1 = ai = 103 for all 1 = i = n. 
Output Format. Output the largest number that can be composed out of a1,a2,...,an.
Sample 1. 
Input: 2 21 2 
Output: 221 
Note that in this case the above algorithm also returns an incorrect answer 212.
11
Sample 2. 
Input: 5 9 4 6 1 9 
Output: 99641 
In this case, the input consists of single-digit numbers only, so the algorithm above computes the right answer.
Sample 3.
Input: 3 23 39 92 
Output: 923923 
As a coincidence, for this input the above algorithm produces the right result, though the input does not have any single-digit numbers.
