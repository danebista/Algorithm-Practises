Longest Common Subsequence of Two Sequences Problem 
Introduction Compute the length of a longest common subsequence of two sequences.
Problem Description Task. 
Given two sequences A = (a1,a2,...,an) and B = (b1,b2,...,bm), 
find the length of their longest common subsequence, i.e., the largest non-negative integer p such that there exist indices 1 = i1 < i2 < иии < ip = n and 1 = j1 < j2 < иии < jp = m, such that ai1 = bj1,...,aip = bjp. Input Format. First line: n. Second line: a1,a2,...,an. Third line: m. Fourth line: b1,b2,...,bm. Constraints. 1 = n,m = 100; -109 < ai,bi < 109. Output Format. Output p.
Sample 1. 
Input: 3 2 7 5 2 2 5 
Output: 2 A common subsequence of length 2 is (2,5).
Sample 2. 
Input: 1 7 4 1 2 3 4 
Output: 0 The two sequences do not share elements.
Sample 3. 
Input: 4 2 7 8 3 4 5 2 8 7 
Output: 2 
One common subsequence is (2,7). Another one is (2,8).
