Problem Description Task. Given two integers a and b, find their greatest common divisor.
Input Format. 
The two integers a,b are given in the same line separated by space. 
Constraints. 1 = a,b = 2·109. 
Output Format. Output GCD(a,b).
Sample 1.
Input 18 35 
Output 1
(18 and 35 do not have common non-trivial divisors.)
Sample 2. Input 28851538 1183019 
Output 17657 
(28851538 = 17657·1634, 1183019 = 17657·67. )
